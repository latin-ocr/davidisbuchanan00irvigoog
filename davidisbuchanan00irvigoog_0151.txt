APPENDIX. 135'

The conclufion of this animadverlion⁸ ssrevrs that Mafler David himself de·

aign'd to write a history of the Scotoh affairs3 and, to make room for this, it
vas necelfury to let the world know that Gange, as well aa his neighbours‚ had
his fuilings. 1 know not whether he ever went any farther that a bare drsught of

some chapters‚ relating to the better understanding of the antiquities and prime state
of the nation; having rank'd fame collefflons under several heads of that nature,
which he did not live to bring into perfect form. Such papers I have feen; and
they discover their author's skill in the Hebrew aud Celtic langnrgm, to have been
much more confiderable than his acquaintance with the Greek and Roman writers,
who are never to 11 made friends with fome of his opinions and etymologica. P. 120.

the author of the present volume may perhaps be inferred, but cannot easily be proved.
